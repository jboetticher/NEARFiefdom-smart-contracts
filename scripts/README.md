# Deployment Instructions for Arda
The only thing that's lacking right now is the way that users pay + initialize their  
NFT tiles seamlessly. I'll finish that soon hopefully.  
Please write deployment scripts so that the ResourceGenerator gets the Minter role  
from the NEARFiefdomNFT. I think that's the only special thing necessary. Also make 
sure that the creator gets the special NFT.  

It would also be great if you could write tests + audit the code so far.
